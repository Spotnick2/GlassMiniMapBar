-- Glass.lua: this addon's instance of the "liquid glass" material.
--
-- The material lives in the embedded library LibGlass-1.0
-- (Libs\LibGlass-1.0, from github.com/Spotnick2/LibGlass through .pkgmeta
-- externals; the TOC loads it first). Its contract, write-up and textures are
-- there: material changes are LibGlass PRs, not edits here.
--
-- An instance, not the library itself: STYLE and the setters are this addon's
-- own, so nothing here touches another glass addon's surfaces. Every call site
-- keeps the dot-call shape (Glass.Apply, Glass.Inset, Glass.STYLE, ...).
-- Glass.MEDIA is the library's folder: the round button's own textures use
-- Orb.MEDIA.
